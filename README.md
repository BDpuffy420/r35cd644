# Goonstation Public Release r35cd644

Hello, this is an official public release of the code for the Goonstation "fork" of Space Station 13. All code is current as of 2016-03-02.

Please note that some areas rely on a central server (bans, playernotes, stat logging etc) that for obvious reasons isn't publically available. As a result, if you wish to use these systems, you will have to code a workaround (shouldn't be especially difficult).
